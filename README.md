Hi All

The current code is for undertanding the basics of Redis. 
Redis provides a caching mechanism to store our data into main memory of cloud servers so to make the access faster from a DB call from disk.

In this project we've implemented caching basics where we are trying to store data to the redis cloud server and retrieving it. In further repos we'll introduce database so that if any key is not found in cache we'll get from the DB and store the info in the cache memory.
